4,Full Album on April th
5,A music video literally never angered me more I love these girls and it s no fault of them but what the label is doing to this group is so shameful Poor Liz got no screen time or lines in the song I repeatedly saw the same girls over and over in this video while she was hidden They couldn t try any harder to hide her It s horrible Someone pick this girl up under a new group so she can be allowed to shine I m so tired of certain girls in this group being so praised by the label while Liz is treated like a background character It s one thing for fandoms to have favorites but for a label to and make it so obvious is messed up It s not even like she s bad her voice is wonderful she s beautiful inside and out and her performance skills are great She knows how to do her job To be treated like a wall because you don t fit your labels beauty standard is disgusting They should drop her from the label if they don t like her instead of suppressing her so she can go elsewhere The song is great really cool video and the girls look and sound beautiful but it s not fair that one of their members is treated so poorly every freaking song performance
